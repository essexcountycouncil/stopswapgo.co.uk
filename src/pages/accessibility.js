			<li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
			<li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
			<li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We&rsquo;ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

		<h3>How we tested this website</h3>
		<p>We last fully tested the site on 10 July 2020 and continue to perform checks and tests as we make updates.</p>

		<h3>Technical information about this website&rsquo;s accessibility</h3>
		<p>Essex County Council is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made">Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018</a>.</p>
		<p>This website is compliant with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a>&nbsp;AA standard, but we would like to highlight the items below.</p>
		
		<h3>Issues with images, video and audio</h3>
		<p>The NHS face covering video features inbuilt captions which are not accessible by a screen reader. A brief summary of the video&rsquo;s content can be found on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NHSwebsite/videos/285626296026059/">original NHS Facebook post</a>.</p>
		<p>&lsquo;Heavy traffic zones&rsquo; shown in our map images are not fully described in text at present. We are working to update this for each school map page.</p>
		<p>Also, even though step-by-step instructions are not included in map images we understand this information can be understood from them. While maps are <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made">generally exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations</a> for this we realise this is still an important part of our content. We&rsquo;ve provided information alongside the maps and created them with contrast levels that meet the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, but if you need the information in an alternative format, email the Equalities and Partnerships Team at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ECC.Equalities@essex.gov.uk">ECC.Equalities@essex.gov.uk</a>.</p>
