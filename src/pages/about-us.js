		<h1>About us</h1>

		<p>At Stop.Swap.<i>GO!</i> we&rsquo;re about making it easier than ever for the people of Essex to
		swap the car for more sustainable ways to travel, like walking, cycling or using the
bus.</p>
		<div className="notice notice-side">
			<h2>Did you know?</h2><p> Up to <span>43%</span> of car trips in Essex districts are
	under <span>3 miles</span>. That&rsquo;s just a <span>15-minute</span> bike ride!</p>
		</div>
		<p>Across this site and on social media we&rsquo;ll give you top tips and advice, the latest
		information on local cycling and walking routes, and a place to swap your own
stories with a growing community.</p>



		<p>Essex is already making a difference with all new temporary and permanent walking
			and cycle lanes and in some places, reduced speed limits.</p>

		<p>Stop.Swap.<i>GO!</i> is part of Essex County Council&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.essex.gov.uk/topic/energy-climate-environment">plans to create a greener Essex</a>. By
making it easier for you to walk, cycle and use the bus, we can reduce carbon
emissions, protect the environment, and help you make the most of our beautiful
county.</p>

		<p>So there&rsquo;s never been a better time to swap the car for the joys of cycling or walking
		to work or school. Stretching your legs or getting out on your bike boosts health and
		wellbeing, it saves money, and it&rsquo;s better for local communities and the Essex
environment. Everybody wins.</p>

			<p>Stop.Swap.<i>GO!</i> is helping people to switch from the car to more active
			and sustainable travel. It&rsquo;s a unique chance to greatly improve our air
quality, our health, and life opportunities for the next generation.</p>
