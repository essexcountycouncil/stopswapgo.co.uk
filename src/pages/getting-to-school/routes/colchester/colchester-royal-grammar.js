		<h2>Getting to and from Colchester Royal Grammar School</h2>
		<p>These routes and maps are suggestions of how you could stop taking the car and swap to cycling, walking, or scooting to school. They don’t show every possible route and you could have fun finding a way that works for you. If you know a safe way that gets you there even quicker, that’s great! Take that route instead.</p>

		<h2>Address</h2>
		<p><a href="https://www.crgs.co.uk/">Colchester Royal Grammar School</a>,<br/>
		6 Lexden Road<br/>
		Colchester<br/>
		Essex<br/>
		CO3 3ND
		</p>

		<h2>Heavy traffic zone</h2>
		<p>The highlighted heavy traffic zone on the map shows the area that will have the heaviest traffic at school time. By using alternate routes and a mix of walking and cycling, you can avoid sitting in traffic and being late for school.</p>

		<h2>Walking routes</h2>
		<p>The area around Colchester Royal Grammar School is quite well served by footpaths. It benefits from its proximity to the town centre and the infrastructure designed for access to that. It has pedestrian access from Lexden Road, but also from the roads on the south and east of the school, helping those walking to school to avoid the heaviest traffic.</p>

		<h2>Cycling routes</h2>
		<p>Lexden Road, at the front of the school, is part of <a href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/find-a-route-on-the-national-cycle-network/route-1/">National Cycle Network route 1</a> into central Colchester, and other off-road routes through <a href="https://www.colchester.gov.uk/info/cbc-article/?catid=country-parks-and-local-nature-reserves&amp;amp;id=KA-01615">Hilly Fields nature reserve</a> are available opposite the school entrance. <a href="https://www.essexhighways.org/getting-around/cycling/routes-and-maps.aspx">The Colchester cycle map</a> can show you other routes which may help.</p>

		<h2>Park &amp; Ride</h2>
		<p><a href="https://www.essexhighways.org/Transport-and-Roads/Getting-Around/Bus/Park-and-Ride.aspx">Park &amp; Ride at Colchester</a> could help you on your journey. </p>

		<h2>Bus routes</h2>
		<p>Lexden Road and Maldon Road are both major bus routes into and out of central Colchester, and almost border the school to the north and south respectively. Stops on Lexden Road have waiting shelters and seats. Both routes link to villages just outside Colchester, like Marks Tey, Layer-de-la-Haye and beyond.</p>

		<h2>Train routes</h2>
		<p>Colchester Royal is under a mile’s walk from Colchester Town train station, and less than a mile and a half from Colchester station. The latter provides quick access via the main East Anglian line to places like Manningtree, Witham, Clacton and Harwich-Dovercourt. Greater Anglia offer <a href="https://www.greateranglia.co.uk/tickets-fares/business-travel/schoolcollege-travel-discounts">discounts on train travel for students</a> at some schools, chat to staff about this.</p>
