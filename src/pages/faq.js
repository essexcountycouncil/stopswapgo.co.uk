		<h2>Why are you using Indeemo? Can you tell me more about it?</h2>
		<p>We have chosen to partner with the Indeemo app to launch our 60 Day Challenge. This is because we have found that the Indeemo app is easy to use, secure, and best serves the purposes of our 60 Day Challenge.</p>
		<p>Indeemo is usually used to run mobile ethnography research projects but we&rsquo;re using it in a slightly different way for our 60 Day Challenge: as a trip diary so you can log and share your walking and cycling stories with us.</p>
		<p>If you need any help using Indeemo, please contact our mailbox at stop.swap.go@essex.gov.uk and we will happily assist you. Thank you.</p>

		<h2>Why is bus travel not included in the 60 Day Challenge?</h2>
		<p>The challenge focusses on walking and cycling to begin with, as bus travel has restrictions on capacity due to social distancing. Good news though, there is a bus-focused initiative coming in the future as part of Stop.Swap.<i>GO!</i></p>

		<h2>Why do you need my postcode and email address when I sign up to the 60 Day Challenge?</h2>
		<p>We need your email address so that we can check that you have registered to the live challenge using the Indeemo app. We&rsquo;ll also use it to contact you in the event that you win one of our available prizes and to share any news or updates about Stop.Swap.GO!. We need your postcode so that we can verify that you live in Essex and are eligible to take part in the 60 Day Challenge.</p>

		<h2>What will you do with any content (notes, comments, photos and videos) I upload to the app during the challenge?</h2>
		<p>If you have consented for us to share your app content uploads as part of our marketing activity we might share your notes, comments, photos and videos as part of our Stop. Swap. <i>GO!</i> content for these channels.</p>
		<p>If you do not want your content to be shared, we will honour your decision to opt-out. Your content will be kept secure within our app platform and will not be shared publicly.</p>
